# Brain: The stroy of you
## David Eagleman

Through the lens of six questions Eagleman explores the 2kg lump of matter that lies between ones temples. Who am I? What is reality? Who is in control? How do I decide? Do I need you? Who will we be?

Who am I? "who you are depends on where you have been" -- David Eagleman. Our brains are affected by every sensory input we encounter thorughout our lives. The sights, sounds, feeling and all the other sensory inputs dictate the people we become. This means we are forever changing, the person we are today might be different to the person we will be tomorrow.

What is reality? "The world around you with its rich textures, colours and scents is an illusion". The world we experience internally is created by the firing of billions of neurons as a result of sensory signals. This means what we see, hear and smell is no more that a model of the outside world based on the firing patterns of our neurones.

Intertwined with some shock stories this chapter lays down the argument that networks of firing neurones are at the forefront of control. These firings give rise to all of our choices, actions, habits and just about everything else.

How do I decide? Competition exists within brains much as it does in other areas of life. Decision arise from the winner of competitions between various networks of neurones. Depending on the stimulation diverent networks will fire resulting in one (or sometimes more) that win out and cause an action to occur.

Do I need you? The state of our internal network relies on the state of the internal networks of others around us. If those internal networks are removed, such as in solitary confinement or the internal network of those around us is in some flux it can cause us to make decisions that would seem alien at any other given point in time.

Who will we be? Can we attach new senses to the brain, will it understand them if we do. It seems so. Can we relocate the brain to other areas, maybe onto silcon. Can we look at consciosness in a different way is it more about the dynamics of a network and less about the medium in which the neurones fit. Is the brain purely computation or is the meaty stuff fundamental?

The book surprises one at every turn, asking enormous questions and providing angles from which to observe the questions through anecdotal evidence.
